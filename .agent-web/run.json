  "goals": "Implement the following features, iterating with small, safe patches until `pnpm build` passes and basic flows work:\r\n\r\n1) Learning Methodologies Pages\r\n   - Create a top page at /methods listing these methodologies with short descriptions:\r\n     \u2022 Active Recall \u2022 Spaced Repetition \u2022 Interleaving \u2022 Deliberate Practice \u2022 Mastery Learning \u2022 Worked Examples \u2022 Fading (Scaffold Reduction) \u2022 Retrieval Practice (with confidence) \u2022 Timed Drills & Benchmarks \u2022 Error Logging & Reflection\r\n   - Each links to /methods/[slug] with a lightweight explainer and how the app supports it.\r\n\r\n2) Time & Score Tracking\r\n   - Track per-item attempts: sessionId (cookie), setId, itemId, section, tags, difficulty, chosen answer, correctness, elapsedMs, timestamp.\r\n   - Persist to Firestore via lib/firestore.ts in collection \"attempts\" -> doc(sessionId) -> subcollection \"events\".\r\n   - Add minimal server actions from /drills to record attempts (avoid public /api where possible).\r\n\r\n3) Fast Content Picker\r\n   - Add a quick picker on /drills (and/or /dashboard) to switch the current content set immediately using existing loader logic.\r\n\r\n4) Recommended Learning (from mistakes)\r\n   - Aggregate recent attempts (e.g., last 50) and rank weak areas by section/tag and difficulty.\r\n   - Add /recommended that shows top weak areas and links to focused drills (or at least presents suggested scopes).\r\n\r\n5) KaTeX & Polish\r\n   - Integrate KaTeX to render LaTeX in items/explanations (minimal deps).\r\n   - Gentle UI polish: spacing, headings, small quality-of-life improvements. Keep changes incremental.\r\n\r\nGuardrails:\r\n- Small diffs only; keep existing features stable. Use server actions over public API. Keep TypeScript strict. Ensure `pnpm build` stays green."
