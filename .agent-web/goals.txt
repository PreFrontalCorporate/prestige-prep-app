Polish + Learning features

1) Fast Content Picker (Drills)
   - Add a compact picker on /drills to switch current content set instantly.
   - Use existing loader logic; keep TypeScript strict.

2) Store Attempts (Server Actions)
   - Capture: sessionId, setId, itemId, section, tags, difficulty, answer, correctness, elapsedMs, confidence, timestamp.
   - Persist to Firestore under attempts/{sessionId}/events.
   - Avoid public APIs when possible; prefer server actions.

3) Attendance Card Upgrade
   - "Punch-in" success animation (confetti/flash) after check-in.
   - Keep animations subtle and fast.

4) Theming & Background Polish
   - Light gradient backgrounds or subtle textures; respect performance.
   - Prepare for dark mode later.

5) Recommended Expansions
   - Aggregate last 50 attempts by tag/section+difficulty.
   - Render top weak areas with a “Start a focused drill” CTA.

Guardrails:
- Small, safe diffs; keep build green.
- No breaking existing flows.
